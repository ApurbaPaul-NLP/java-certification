# Java Environment Overview

---

## Introduction
- Java is one of the most widely used programming languages.  
- It is derived from C and shares similarities with C++.  
- Java follows the **object-oriented programming (OOP)** paradigm, allowing programmers to define custom data types along with their permitted operations.

---

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and JVM
- To run Java programs, a computer must have **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** installed.  
- A key component of JRE is the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, which provides an environment where Java programs interact with the hardware.

---

## Java Source Code and Bytecode
- A Java program is written as **source code**, which is a text file following Java syntax with a `.java` extension.  
- Compilation produces **Java bytecode**, saved as a `.class` file.  
- To compile Java source code, the machine requires the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**, which is an extended version of JRE.

---

## Structure of Java Language in JDK
- JDK provides two main parts:  
  1. **java.lang** – the essential core of Java  
  2. Optional packages – additional source code libraries that can be imported into programs

---

## Writing Java Programs
- A **text editor** is required to write and edit Java source code.  
- Some editors provide syntax highlighting and other assistance.  
- Popular text editors include: **Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text**.

---

## Compilation of Java Programs
- Converting Java source code into bytecode is called **compilation**.  
- Compilation can be done using a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.

### Command Line Interfaces
- macOS: **Terminal**  
- Windows: **Command Prompt (cmd)**  
- Other CLI tools are available for download.

---

### How CLI Works
- CLI allows users to interact with the computer using text commands.  
- A command is a sequence of characters typed to perform an action.  
- While typing, the characters appear on the screen (**echo**).  
- After pressing **Enter/Return**, the CLI parses the command according to its syntax.  
- If the command is correct, the action is executed.  
- The CLI prints output on the screen. If there is too much text, the screen scrolls to show the most recent lines.  
- If the command is incorrect, an **error message** is displayed.  
- The CLI shows a **prompt** (e.g., `% ` or `>`) to indicate it is ready for the next command.

---

## Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
- An **IDE** combines a program editor and CLI with additional features to simplify writing large programs.  
- Popular Java IDEs: **Eclipse**, **NetBeans**.

---

## Summary
- Java is object-oriented and platform-independent.  
- JRE and JVM are needed to run Java programs.  
- Source code is compiled into bytecode using JDK.  
- Text editors, CLI, and IDEs facilitate program creation and execution.
